/**
 * From "Use GWTTestSuite padawan":
 * <p/>
 * GWTTestCase derived tests are slow. This is because the JUnitShell has to load the
 * module for each test (create the shell, hook into it, etc). GWTTestSuite mitigates
 * this by grouping all the tests that are for the same module
 * (those that return the same value for getModuleName) together and running them
 * via the same shell instance.
 * <p/>
 * We recommend to name your test suite GwtTestSuite.java so that the test filter picks it up,
 * but name the actual tests with a convention that Surefire will ignore by default - something
 * that does not start with GwtTest, and does not start or end with Test. For example MyClassTestGwt.java.
 * This way, gwt-maven-plugin picks up the Suite, and runs it, but does not also run individual
 * tests (and Surefire does not pick it up either)
 * <p/>
